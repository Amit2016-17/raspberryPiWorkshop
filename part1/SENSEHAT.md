# SenseHAT

Use the SenseHAT output node to:

- Set the entire LED panel to a set colour
- Set an individual pixel to a set colour

Exercise - set the background to be blue with a yellow line of pixel diagonally across the panel and a red line across the other diagonal.

Use the SenseHAT input node to:

- Select the set of outputs (Environment sensors, motion and joystick)
- Use the debug node to investigate the format of the data

Exercise - Set the LED panel to the following colours depending on the temperature:

- Blue when temp is less than 0C
- Azul/Turquoise when the temp is 0C or above, but less than 15C
- Green when the temp is 15C or above, but less than 25C
- Yellow when the temp is 25C or above, but less than 40C
- red when the temp is 40C or above

To be able to test your solution use the SenseHAT simulator nodes
