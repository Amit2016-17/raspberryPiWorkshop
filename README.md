# Welcome to the Raspberry Pi IoT Workshop

IoT workshop based on a Raspberry Pi with a SenseHAT or DHT11/22 and NeoPixel RGB LED

# Real World IoT with the Raspberry Pi

## Stream Environmental Conditions to Watson IoT and Analyse IoT Sensor data

Learn how to connect a Raspberry Pi to Watson IoT over MQTT and stream environmental data from the sensors to the IBM Cloud.Â  Workshop attendees will learn about Node-RED programming on the Raspberry Pi and IBM Cloud, IoT Security, MQTT, Watson IoT Platform, cloud storage, data analytics and visualisation techniques.

Follow the links to access the different sections of the course:

### [Part 1](/part1/README.md)

Provides an overview to the course, introduces the hardware and the Node-RED programming environment.  It gets you programming the Raspberry Pi device to be able to access and control the hardware.
Part 1 finishes with an overview of the IBM Cloud, the cloud platform used in this workshop and ensures you have a working cloud account with the required resources.

### [Part 2](/part2/README.md)

The second part of the workshop looks at the Internet of Things service on the IBM Cloud and how you connect a device to the IBM Cloud using the MQTT protocol.  This section also looks at ensuring you have a secure connection between the device and the Cloud Platform, using SSL/TLS security and certificates.

### [Part 3](/part3/README.md)

In this section we look at using Node-RED on the IBM Cloud to implement the server side part of the IoT solution.  You will create a dashboard to visualise the IoT data.  Your server side application will also control the LED attached to the Raspberry Pi, either the SenseHAT or Neopixel.

### [Part 4](/part4/README.md)

The last part of the workshop looks at how useful information can be extracted from the IoT data using analytics.  You will be introduced to the Analytic services available on the IBM Cloud and the tooling the services provide to help you extract useful information from sensor data.

Timing of the day can be found in the [**agenda**](/AGENDA.md)

We've provided all the links used throughout the workshop as well as links to other resources [**here**](/RESOURCES.md) to help you explore a little more about IoT.
